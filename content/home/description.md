Within communication, the awareness beyond the exchange of information, the emotions and intentions behind information, is often misunderstood and rarely discussed or taught even though feelings are a significant communication component. Consequently, when individuals communicate, misunderstandings and frustrations occur.  Market researchers for B2C companies rely on their ability to quickly and correctly determine consumer emotions and sentiment. Therefore, many have implemented machine learning models into their workflow to reduce their barrier to interpreting emotion and intention. Even though machine learning evolution opened many doors for emotion detection through facial recognition and text and audio analysis, a disconnect between a model's ability to accurately determine human emotion subsists. Words, tone, and body language are essential to infer emotion, but current models consider only unimodal data. To most accurately track consumers' emotions, this project took into account more emotion inference channels. Therefore, market researchers can reduce the time spent attempting and failing to understand what consumers honestly think, feel, and behave the way they do. In turn, they can spend more time on the core of their work: creating human-centered and emotionally powerful consumers' stories for their clients. More broadly, this project can help individuals better understand emotion to support effective communication.
